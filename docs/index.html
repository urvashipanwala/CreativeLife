                <p>Leonardo da Vinci was an artist, architect, anatomist, engineer, mathematician, sculptor, inventor, geologist, and botanist. Da Vinci was a great Italian artist who was interested in everything. According to da Vinci's belief, science and art both profoundly influence each other. In his presence from 1452 to 1519, he graced the world by leaving a significant legacy not only in the field of art but in science, as well. Even after his death, his inventions influenced and gave people the inspiration and imagination to create and expand more on his designs.
